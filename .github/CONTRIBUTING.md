## Code Contributions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.17.0
- Yarn >= 1.22 or NPM >= 10.8
- Familiarity with React, TypeScript, and SCSS modules

### Steps to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository** and clone it locally.
2. **Install dependencies:**

yarn install
```

3. Run the development environment:

yarn dev
```

4. Make your changes in a new branch with a descriptive name.

5. Test your changes in all supported browsers and screen sizes.

6. Add or update documentation if applicable.

### Style & Guidelines

To maintain a consistent codebase across packages:

- **TypeScript**: Fully typed APIs, strict mode enabled.
- **SCSS**: Alphabetically ordered, modular, scoped per component.
- **Naming Conventions**: `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for props and functions.
- **Linting & Formatting**: ESLint and Prettier are enforced. Run:

```bash
yarn lint
yarn format
```

- **Commit Messages**: Use conventional commits for clarity (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore).

## Branching & Workflow

- **Main Branch:** `main` (stable production-ready code)
- **Development Branches:** `feature/<feature-name>` or `bugfix/<issue-name>`
- **Pull Requests:** Target `main` or a feature branch as specified

All PRs should pass tests and CI checks before being merged.
